This transformation is lossy but very useful when the full complexity of the `Catalog` object isn't warranted. By default the `events_to_df` function collects information the authors of ObsPlus have found useful, but it is fully extensible/customizable using the functionality of the [DataFrameExtractor](../utils/dataframeextractor.ipynb)."
