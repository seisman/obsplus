    "The Fetcher class builds on the unified data request interfaces to provide convenient methods for working with whole datasets. Specifically, you can:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Get continuous data using channels contained in an inventory (or returned from a station_client).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate over events and their corresponding waveforms, which have channels defined by the station_client. \n",

    "We will use a Fetcher from the TA and Crandall dataset to demonstrate different aspects of the `Fetcher` functionality."
